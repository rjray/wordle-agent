# Wordle Agent

This is a Python-based framework and agent for attempting to solve all the
puzzles of [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) with 100%
success. This is my Reinforcement Learning project for the 2022 Spring semester
Machine Learning course for my MS program in Computer Science.

(Note: the word lists, both answers and allowed guesses, are based on the
original Wordle lists prior to its sale to the New York Times.)

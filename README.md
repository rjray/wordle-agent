# Wordle Agent

This is a Python-based framework and agent for attempting to solve all the
puzzles of [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) with 100%
success. This is my Reinforcement Learning project for the 2022 Spring semester
Machine Learning course for my MS program in Computer Science.

(Note: the word lists, both answers and allowed guesses, are based on the
original Wordle lists prior to its sale to the New York Times.)

## March 20, 2022 (tag: submitted)

The tag `submitted` will be applied to the version of this repository that I
submit as the final project. However, I hope to continue work on this as time
allows. Some additional work I would like to do includes:

1. Parameterize things like the length of the game (number of guesses), etc.
2. Test it against word lists from different languages
3. Add at least two additional heuristic actions to the learning agents
4. Consider other learning algorithms as well
5. Improve performance and improve the scripts used to create the graphs
